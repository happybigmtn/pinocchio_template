   - Both used the same handler function

2. **Authority Instructions** ✅

#### Benefits
- Simpler API surface
- Less code duplication
- Easier to maintain
- Reduced program size

### 2025-07-09 - Critical Fixes Applied

#### 1. Fixed Critical Bet Encoding Bug ✅
**Time**: 10:15 AM  
**File**: `src/instructions/betting.rs:206`  
**Issue**: Bet amounts were being truncated to 10 bits directly instead of using the proper encoding function  
**Fix**: Changed from:
```rust
let packed_bet = ((bet_kind as u16) & 0x3F) | (((bet_amount as u16) & 0x3FF) << 6);
```
To:
```rust
let packed_bet = crate::utils::bet_encoding::encode_bet(bet_kind, bet_amount)?;
```
**Impact**: Critical - without this fix, all bet amounts would be corrupted

#### 2. Payout Calculation Already Implemented ✅
**Time**: 10:30 AM  
**Discovery**: Payout calculation logic already exists in `src/instructions/claim.rs`
- `calculate_bet_payout()` function at line 292
- Comprehensive evaluation functions for all 64 bet types
- No additional implementation needed

#### 3. Fixed Phantom State Setters ✅
**Time**: 10:45 AM  
**Files Modified**:
- `src/state/game.rs` - Removed phantom setter methods
- `src/state/rng.rs` - Removed phantom setter methods  
- `src/instructions/initialize.rs` - Updated to use real fields
- `src/instructions/player.rs` - Removed unused player count tracking

**Changes**:
- Removed non-existent field setters like `set_total_players()`, `set_total_deposited()`, etc.
- Updated initialization to use actual struct fields
- Program now compiles with only 6 warnings (unused variables)

#### 4. Created Integration Tests ✅
**Time**: 11:00 AM  
**Files Created**:
- `tests/integration_tests.rs` - Working Mollusk integration tests
- `tests/mollusk_integration.rs` - Comprehensive test suite (has compatibility issues)

### 2025-07-09 - RNG Security Enhancement
**Time**: 11:45 AM  
**Status**: Completed ✅

#### Changes Made
1. **Increased Block Hash Requirements**
   - `REQUIRED_BLOCK_HASHES`: 5 → 10 
   - `MAX_BLOCK_HASHES`: 10 → 15 (buffer for edge cases)
   - Files modified:
     - `src/constants.rs` - Updated constants
     - `src/state/rng.rs` - Updated hardcoded checks

2. **Security Benefits**
   - **Better Entropy**: More block hashes = more unpredictable randomness
   - **Attack Resistance**: Harder to manipulate or predict outcomes
   - **Future-Proof**: Can adjust down if needed, but starting secure

3. **Technical Details**
   - RngState struct already supports 10 hashes (320 bytes storage)
   - Collection phase now requires 10 successful hash collections
   - XOR mixing combines all 10 hashes for final entropy

4. **Impact**
   - Slightly longer collection phase (~4-5 additional slots)
   - Significantly stronger security against RNG manipulation
   - No breaking changes to existing code structure

### 2025-07-09 - Test Coverage Expansion
**Time**: 12:00 PM  
**Status**: In Progress 🔄

#### Update (12:30 PM)
Successfully created comprehensive test framework with 3 major test files covering different aspects of the system. While compilation issues remain due to API mismatches and struct field differences, the test structure provides solid foundation for achieving 80% coverage once fixed.

   - Dice validation tests (all 36 combinations)
   - RNG entropy mixing edge cases
   - State boundary tests
   - Treasury limit tests
   - Concurrent operation tests
